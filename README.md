##About Me:
 My name is Dallas Perdue. I am a North Carolina native. This is my second semester at Wake tech, but first semester as a Infomation tech major. Before I attended WTCC I served in the United States Navy for 10 years. I truly enough the outdoors. Since this is my first class in this major I want to learn most of the basics when it comes to programming. I don't have a ton of computer experience but one thing my military service taught me is how to be adaptable. Like a sponge I want want to soak in as much knowledge as possible.
