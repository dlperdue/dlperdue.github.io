# About Me: My name is Dallas Perdue. I am a North Carolina native. This is my second semester at Wake tech, but first semester as a Infomation tech major.  Before I attended WTCC I served in the United States Navy for ten years.  Since this is my first class in this major I want to learn most of the basics when it comes to programming. I don't have a ton of computer experience but one thing my military service taught me is how to be adaptable. Like a sponge I want want to soak in as much knowledge as possible.

## My interest:
* firearms 
* motors 
* DIY projects

## Websites I recommend: 
1. [PSA](https://palmettostatearmory.com/) I recommend this website because their products are the best bang for your buck. 
2. [Harley](https://www.harley-davidson.com/us/en/reveal/h-d-25-launch.html?source_cd=SEM_Retention_PPC%7CMICROSOFT%7CCore_Brand_E%7CBrand%7Charley+davidson&_cr=ppc%7CMICROSOFT%7CCore_Brand_E%7CBrand%7Charley+davidson&s_kwcid=AL%2115884%2110%2176553665651440%2126782550679&gclid=8eff86afa74c1ad525a3e13d2a5737ac&gclsrc=3p.ds&msclkid=8eff86afa74c1ad525a3e13d2a5737ac&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Core_Brand_E&utm_term=harley+davidson&utm_content=Brand) I recommend this website because nothing will ever compare to a harley-davidson motorcycle.
